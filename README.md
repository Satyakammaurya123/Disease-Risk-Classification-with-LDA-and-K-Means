# Disease-Risk-Classification-with-LDA-and-K-Means

ðŸš€ Unlock the Potential of Machine Learning in Healthcare!
This project leverages Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for dimensionality reduction and K-Means Clustering for patient stratification. By analyzing real-world heart disease data, we classify individuals into risk groupsâ€”Low Risk, Moderate Risk, and High Riskâ€”empowering data-driven healthcare decisions.

ðŸ“Š Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Seamless handling of medical datasets for optimal insights.
Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying complex data with LDA.
Unsupervised Learning: Identifying meaningful clusters using K-Means.
Interactive Visualizations: Clear and insightful graphs for better understanding.
ðŸ’¡ Applications:

Personalized healthcare interventions.
Preventive strategies for at-risk groups.
Advanced analysis for health data scientists.
